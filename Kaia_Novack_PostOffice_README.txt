This program allows the user to enter dimensions such as length, height, and thickness to allow the computer to classify the type of package. Then, in the same line, the user enters the zip code they are mailing from and the zip code they are mailing to. The computer intakes these inputs and classifies the zip codes as zones and uses these zones to identify how far the user wants to mail their package. Finally, using the numbers from the package type and the zones, the computer generates a price for the user.
